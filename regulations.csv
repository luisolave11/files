CHAPTER VIII,Article 8.7," Students with Academic Dismissal standing can be readmitted if they acquired this standing during the academic period in which, if they had passed all their educational units, they would have concluded the curriculum of their program. This case will be judged by a committee whose structure and process is defined by the Office of the Academic and Educational Innovation Vice Rector. This committee’s decision can be:  1.	Immediate readmission to the Institution. 2.	Postponed readmission to the Institution. 3.	Ratification of Academic Dismissal at the undergraduate.         "
CHAPTER VIII,Article 8.8," For students who do not reenroll consecutively in the semester or trimester academic periods and/or apply to withdraw from all their educational units, and are readmitted, the failed educational units accumulated at the undergraduate level will be considered, together with their advancement in the degree to which they have been readmitted, with the exception of students who have received an undergraduate degree at Tecnológico de Monterrey and wish to study a second undergraduate degree. In the latter cases, on being admitted to the second degree, only the failed educational units that are equivalent in the new undergraduate degree or exploration area will be considered.  If students are enrolled in more than one undergraduate degree or exploration area and have Conditional or Academic Dismissal Standing, such standing will apply to all the undergraduate degrees or exploration areas in which they are enrolled.                                                          "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.1," Academic integrity means acting in an honest, committed, reliable, responsible, fair and respectful manner in learning, research and cultural diffusion. Academic integrity violations are considered to be any individual or collective action or omission committed by students, inside or outside the classroom, which violates the principles of academic integrity and/or seeks to facilitate an academic benefit or advantage. Some examples of these wrongful actions or omissions are: copying or attempted copying in any type of exam or learning activity; total or partial plagiarism; facilitating any activity or material so that it can be copied and/or presented as the student’s own; identity theft; accessing and/or managing, without express authorization, institutional email accounts or systems; falsifying information; tampering with academic documents; selling or buying exams or distributing them by any means; wrongfully removing or obtaining information or stealing information or attempting to bribe a faculty member or any collaborator at the Institution; and wrongfully altering clinical records, among other actions.  The examples set forth in the previous paragraph are illustrative but not exhaustive. "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.2," Any student, faculty member, institutional authority, member of the educational community or external entities linked to the academic process, who are aware of any act that could constitute an academic integrity violation must inform the Campus Academic Integrity of the same through the channels assigned for this purpose, including all the information and evidence available at the time of the report and that demonstrate the event. The Campus Academic Integrity Commit- tee will analyze the case and notify the reported student of the process and the possible consequences.            "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.3," Academic integrity violations will be dealt with as follows:  1.	When students commit a violation of academic integrity, their professor will assign a failing grade in the corresponding academic activity, module, or final grade of the educational unity. When the failing grade is assigned to a final grade for an educational unit delivered by a team of professors there must be mutual agreement among the professors who deliver the same. The failing grade assigned by the professor is final and cannot be appealed, and is in addition to the consequences determined by the Campus Academic Integrity Committee. 2.	Once the violation has been identified, the professor will inform the student of the situation, assign the failing grade, and report the violation to the Campus Academic Integrity Committee. To this end, the professor must describe the situation, indicate the failing grade assigned, and attach the available evidence. 3.	The Campus Academic Integrity Committee will analyze the case, determine the gravity of the violation and the applicable sanction. When the Committee deems that, owing to its gravity, the violation warrants probation, temporary suspension or definitive dismissal, it informs the student of the initiation of the procedure and calls the student to an audience in which he or she can contribute evidence and express anything he or she deems to be in his or her favor. "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.4," The consequences that can be determined by the Campus Academic Integrity Committee can be any of the following:  a.	Formative measure: activities whose purpose is to encourage the student to reflect on what happened, thereby developing his or her ethical conscience and providing tools for making ethical decisions in difficult circumstances. If the student does not complete the formative measure under the terms and in the periods set by the Committee, the consequence will be probation status for the academic integrity violation. b.	Formative measure in the final period: this is a consequence applicable to students who are graduation candidates and have incurred in academic integrity violations, implying that the student will delay the graduation process until he or she has completed the formative measures determined by the Academic Integrity Committee. Students who fulfill the measure in        due time and form can continue with their graduation process; otherwise, their noncompliance could delay such process for two academic periods, be they semester, trimester or intensive, without exceeding one calendar year. c.	Probation Status for Academic Integrity Violations: An academic condition through which the students is subject to no committing another integrity violation throughout the remainder of his or her studies, since any reoffence could affect his or her continuance at the Institution. This status is recorded in the student’s transcript and has the following implications: 1.	It prevents the students from receiving honors upon graduation. 2.	Probation status remains on the student’s transcripts and is valid until he or she completes the current level of studies. 3.	The students loses the right to take the regularization exam for the class in which the integrity violation occurred. d.	Probation and temporary suspension: this implies, apart from probation with the characteristics described in the previous point, the student’s separation from the institution for 1 to 4 academic periods, be they semester, trimester or intensive, without exceeding one calendar year. During this period, the student must fulfill the accompaniment plan indicated by the Campus Academic Integrity Committee in order to apply for reincorporation into the institution, maintaining the probation status for academic integrity violations. e.	Definitive withdrawal: consists of the separation of the student from the Institution in all its campuses or locations, during the level of studies that they are studying or permanently. "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.5," Only violations whose consequence was the assignment of temporary suspension or definitive dismissal from the Institution can be appealed. All appeals must be presented in writing to the Campus Academic Integrity Committee no later than five business days from the academic calendar, as of the date on which the Committee notified the student of the consequence. The Campus Academic Integrity Committee will send the appeal to the National Academic Integrity Committee, which will issue its final resolution within no more than ten business days from the academic calendar, as of the date on which the appeal was received. The decision of the National Academic Integrity Committee is final and cannot be appealed. "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.6," Students who are carrying out studies, internships or research stays at       organizations and universities with which Tecnológico de Monterrey has signed a collaboration agreement, and violate any of the precepts related to academic integrity, will be sanctioned in accordance with its regulations and the provisions set forth herein. "
CHAPTER IX,Article 9.7 (transitory)," These regulations apply to all students as of the date of promulgation. Hereinafter, the cases recorded as “AD” or “Academic Dishonesty” will be treated by the Campus Academic Integrity Committee as an “academic integrity violation.” The grade “AD” will continue to be considered as a failing grade under the previous terms, for the calculation of academic standing and the grade average, and for the award of academic honors.
